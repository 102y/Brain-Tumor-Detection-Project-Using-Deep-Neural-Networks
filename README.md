# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Project-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks
This project aims to develop an AI model to detect brain tumors by analyzing medical images using deep learning techniques. The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze images and classify them into “healthy” and “infected” categories.
Features
Image Analysis: Load a new image and determine whether it contains a tumor or not.
Plot Tumor Regions: If a tumor is present, a rectangle is drawn around the suspicious area in the image.
Comprehensive Classification Report: Provides an accurate report on the model performance using confusion matrix and classification report.
Data Expansion: Use data expansion techniques to improve model accuracy and reduce overtraining.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
How to Use
Download the project or clone it using Git.
Make sure you have installed all the requirements using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the data by uploading images to the specified folders. Run the program using:
python test.py
Enter the path of the image to be analyzed.
comments
Ensure that the images used to train the model are available in the specified folders. You can modify the model parameters and expansion data to achieve the best performance.
