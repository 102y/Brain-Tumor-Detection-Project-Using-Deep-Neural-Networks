# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Project-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks
This project aims to develop an AI model to detect brain tumors by analyzing medical images using deep learning techniques. The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze images and classify them into “healthy” and “infected” categories.
